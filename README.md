# iso20022
A package to create and manage ISO20022 XML files to create and receive payments.

## About

The mission of this NPM package is to make it easy to create and manage extensible XML functions.

This repository contains classes that can serialize ISO 20022 files. why unique advantage about this module is that it relies on JSX to formulate the XML. The intention of this project is to remain very close to the spec of ISO 20022 and in general keep the interfaces the same.

You might want to use this package if you need to create these types of files.
