# iso20022.js (WIP ðŸš§)
iso20022.js is a Node library for creating and managing ISO 20022 XML files.

ISO20022 is the standard format for financial transactions. This library aims to build a standard interface to create these files, following Typescript conventions. 

iso20022.js is currently in development and not ready for use. It is not recommended to use this library in a production environment yet. We expect to have a stable release in the next few days.

## About

The mission of this NPM package is to make it easy to create and manage extensible XML functions.

This repository contains classes that can serialize ISO 20022 files. why unique advantage about this module is that it relies on JSX to formulate the XML. The intention of this project is to remain very close to the spec of ISO 20022 and in general keep the interfaces the same.

You might want to use this package if you need to create these types of files. 

# Installation

npm install iso20022.js
